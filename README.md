_Shudder_ is a 3D game created for our highschool senior project by a team of 2 utilizing Blender and Unreal Engine 5. This was our capstone project, so it was a cumulation of all the knowledge we've learned for three years, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and the first half of out C++ class (the class this was made for).

## 📜 Description

_Shudder_ is a 3D horror/puzzle game consisting of one level, a house. The player has to manage the battery of their flashlight, not using it too much, and pick up batteries when necessary. To get out, there is one main puzzle utilizing the color wheel, Morse Code, and alphabetical numeration. Completing these puzzles gives you the padlock code to escape the house. While the player is doing all of this, there is an AI monster roaming around that will reset progress if the player is killed. The player has some methods to hide from the monster, such as hiding in beds, closets, and closing doors since the monster cannot open doors.

### Features:
- **Gravity Switch**: A box interactable with an arrow indicating which way gravity will be flipped. There is a cooldown at the bottom left of the screen that shows when you can flip gravity again.
  
- **Spike**: A triangular obstacle that will kill the player if touched. There are stationary spikes and moving spikes, which activate once the player passes the x-coordinate of the spike.

- **Ice**: A rectangular obstacle, usually embedded into the floor, that will freeze horizontal movement until the player leaves the ice.

-  **Surfboard**: A box-shaped obstacle that moves very freely when the player stands on top of it. Gravity affects the surfboard, but not as much as it does with the player.

## 🚀 Things We Should Have Done

While this project served as a great learning experience, there are many areas that could have been improved:

- **Audio**: There was no audio, although we did start writing code for it.
  
- **Hard Code**: The levels are hard coded a little too much, especially level 8. Code for the levels could be greatly simplified and reduced.

- **Gravity**: Originally the whole map was the rotate but we couldn't figure that out. Gravity changed horizontally could have been a nice touch.

- **Action Listener**: We should've code the controls you don't have to click at the exact moment, but can click a little before. 

- **Menu Buttons**: Some of the menu buttons don't work and need to be clicked several times - only the death menu.

- **Static**: At the time of the project, we didn't really understand what static did and would make mostly everything static because Eclipse would tell us.

- **Surfboard**: Originally the surfboard was supposed to be a push box, but the push block code made a surfboard instead.

-  **Level Design**: The level design is mostly lacking and there are only 8 levels.

## 🧹 Post Completion Cleanup

Cleanup was done after completion of Possibility, limited functionality changes were implemented.

- **Usage**: [UCDetector](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/unnecessary-code-detector) was used to find and remove unecessary code.

- **Modifiers**: [UCDetector](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/unnecessary-code-detector) was used to located and change unnecessary modifiers.

- **Imports**: Unecessary imports were removed. Imports were changed to be sorted from top to bottom: packages, classes, third-party libraries, and Java libraries.

- **Attributes**: Class attributes were organized in order from top to bottom in memory size then objects. Depending on context, variables were converted to single line declarations versus multiple lines.

- **Media**: The media classes [AnimationLoader.java](https://github.com/Possibility-1B/Possibility/blob/main/src/Media/AnimationLoader.java) and [ImageLoader.java](https://github.com/Possibility-1B/Possibility/blob/main/src/Media/ImageLoader.java) were altered to use a HashMap instead of multiple variables. File paths were changed to be Jar friendly using getResourceAsStream().

- **Level Completion**: Originally there was a variable keeping track of level completion to enforce levels had to be completed in succcession but wasn't ever used. This was fixed.
