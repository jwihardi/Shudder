_Possibility_ is a 2D game developed as part of a themed senior high school project (2022) by a team of three collaborators. The theme was duality which we translated into the game using Java and Slick2D through the mechanics of reversing gravity.

## üìú Description

_Possibility_ is a 2D side scroller and platformer consisting of 8 levels where the player has to obtain a key to pass through the level door. 

### Features:
- **Gravity Switch**: A box interactable with an arrow indicating which way gravity will be flipped. There is a cooldown at the bottom left of the screen that shows when you can flip gravity again.
  
- **Spike**: A triangular obstacle that will kill the player if touched. There are stationary spikes and moving spikes, which activate once the player passes the x-coordinate of the spike.

- **Ice**: A rectangular obstacle, usually embedded into the floor, that will freeze horizontal movement until the player leaves the ice.

-  **Surfboard**: A box-shaped obstacle that moves very freely when the player stands on top of it. Gravity affects the surfboard, but not as much as it does with the player.

## üöÄ Things We Should Have Done

While this project served as a great learning experience, there are many areas that could have been improved:

- **Audio**: There was no audio, although we did start writing code for it.
  
- **Hard Code**: The levels are hard coded a little too much, especially level 8. Code for the levels could be greatly simplified and reduced.

- **Gravity**: Originally the whole map was the rotate but we couldn't figure that out. Gravity changed horizontally could have been a nice touch.

- **Action Listener**: We should've code the controls you don't have to click at the exact moment, but can click a little before. 

- **Menu Buttons**: Some of the menu buttons don't work and need to be clicked several times - only the death menu.

- **Static**: At the time of the project, we didn't really understand what static did and would make mostly everything static because Eclipse would tell us.

- **Surfboard**: Originally the surfboard was supposed to be a push box, but the push block code made a surfboard instead.

-  **Level Design**: The level design is mostly lacking and there are only 8 levels.

## üßπ Post Completion Cleanup

Cleanup was done after completion of Possibility, limited functionality changes were implemented.

- **Usage**: [UCDetector](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/unnecessary-code-detector) was used to find and remove unecessary code.

- **Modifiers**: [UCDetector](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/unnecessary-code-detector) was used to located and change unnecessary modifiers.

- **Imports**: Unecessary imports were removed. Imports were changed to be sorted from top to bottom: packages, classes, third-party libraries, and Java libraries.

- **Attributes**: Class attributes were organized in order from top to bottom in memory size then objects. Depending on context, variables were converted to single line declarations versus multiple lines.

- **Media**: The media classes [AnimationLoader.java](https://github.com/Possibility-1B/Possibility/blob/main/src/Media/AnimationLoader.java) and [ImageLoader.java](https://github.com/Possibility-1B/Possibility/blob/main/src/Media/ImageLoader.java) were altered to use a HashMap instead of multiple variables. File paths were changed to be Jar friendly using getResourceAsStream().

- **Level Completion**: Originally there was a variable keeping track of level completion to enforce levels had to be completed in succcession but wasn't ever used. This was fixed.
